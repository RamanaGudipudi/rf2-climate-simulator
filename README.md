# RF2 Industry Decarbonization Challenge Simulator

This Streamlit application demonstrates why one-size-fits-all climate targets fail across different industries, highlighting the need for Research Frontier 2 (RF2) - industry-specific decarbonization pathways.

## Overview

Current climate frameworks apply uniform reduction targets (like 4.2% annual reductions) across all industries. This simulator reveals why this approach creates fundamental misalignments between climate ambition and operational reality.

## Features

- **Industry Comparison**: Explore emission profiles across Food & Beverage, Technology, and Heavy Manufacturing sectors
- **Scope 3 Breakdown**: Visualize complex value chain dependencies
- **Cost Sensitivity Analysis**: Understand how external factors affect decarbonization economics
- **Challenge Identification**: Highlight specific barriers each industry faces

## Based on Scientific Research

This simulator is based on the research paper "Operationalizing corporate climate action through five research frontiers" which identifies critical gaps in current corporate climate frameworks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rf2-climate-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run rf2_streamlit_app.py
```

## Key Insights Demonstrated

1. **Materiality Mismatch**: Industries have vastly different emission profiles
2. **Guidance Gaps**: Most Scope 3 emissions lack industry-specific support
3. **Cost Variability**: Abatement costs vary dramatically across sectors
4. **Dynamic Complexity**: External factors create investment uncertainty

## Purpose

This is a "problem awareness" tool designed to:
- Highlight the complexity of corporate decarbonization
- Demonstrate why uniform approaches fail
- Make the case for scientific research into industry-specific pathways
- Support advocacy for RF2 research development

## Usage for LinkedIn/Outreach

Perfect for:
- Climate researchers sharing insights
- Corporate sustainability professionals
- Policy makers understanding implementation challenges
- Anyone interested in science-based climate action

## Data Sources

- Industry emission profiles based on NZDPU data analysis
- Cost ranges from peer-reviewed literature
- Challenge identification from corporate climate surveys

## Next Steps

This simulator demonstrates the problem - the solution requires dedicated research into RF2: Industry-Specific Decarbonization Blueprints.
